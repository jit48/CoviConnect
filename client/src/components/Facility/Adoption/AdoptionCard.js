            <p>
                Adoption is the social, emotional, and legal process in which children who will not be raised by their birth parents become
                full and permanent legal members of another family while maintaining genetic and psychological connections to their birth
                family. Adoption has many facets and touches people in different waysâ€”depending on their role and perspective.

                            The circumstances surrounding your birth are not as important as the opportunity to live. Every child deserves a
                            home and love. Period. Adopt a child and make your and their life happy.
